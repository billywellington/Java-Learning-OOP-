# Java Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **Java Learning Repository**!  
This repo tracks my progress as I learn and explore **Java programming**, especially **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts using IntelliJ IDEA.

---

## 📌 Purpose

This repository is meant to:
- Practice core Java syntax and structure.
- Learn and apply OOP principles like **classes**, **objects**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, **abstraction**, and **encapsulation**.
- Track my progress and growth in Java.

## 🛠️ Topics Covered

✔️ Basic Syntax  
✔️ Variables & Data Types  
✔️ Control Flow (if, switch, loops)  
✔️ Methods and Parameters  
✔️ Classes and Objects  
✔️ Constructors  
✔️ Inheritance  
✔️ Polymorphism  
✔️ Encapsulation  
✔️ Abstract Classes & Interfaces  
✔️ Exception Handling  
✔️ File I/O (soon...)

## 💻 How to Run the Java Files

Follow these steps to set up your environment and run the Java programs from this repository.

### 1️⃣ Install Java (JDK)

You’ll need **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed.

#### **Windows**
1. Download the latest JDK from [Oracle Java Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Verify installation:
   
```bash
   java -version
````

You should see the installed Java version.

#### **Mac**

1. Install via [Oracle Java Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) **or** with Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install openjdk
   ```
2. Verify:

   ```bash
   java -version
   ```

#### **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
java -version
```
